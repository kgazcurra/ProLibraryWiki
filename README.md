ProLibrary is a collection of scripts including **Extensions**, common **Data Structures**, **Pathfinding** algorithms, **Managers** and **Utilities** that were designed to make your work _easier_ and _faster_.

Many times when starting a new project we find ourselves **needing** many of these scripts. The thing is, we've all used some in previous projects but most of the time they are outdated, not generic enough to simply adapt to our current project, or we might not remember exactly how to use them.

By downloading ProLibrary you make sure said scripts are **generic**, well **documented** and being **maintained** by a third party without you having to worry about it.
